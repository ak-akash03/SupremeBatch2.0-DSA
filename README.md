1) What Is Time Complexity ?
-> Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of 
   length of input.

2) Why to Study T&S Complexity ?
-> 1. Good computer engineer always thinks about the complexity 
      of the code written by him.
   2. Resource are limited
   3. Measure algorithm to make efficient programs.
   4. Asked by interviewer after every solution you give.

3) What is Space Complexity ?
-> 1. Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of
      length of input

4) Unit to Represent Complextity
-> 1. Big O : Upper Bound
   2. Theta ʘ : Average Case
   3. Omega ɲ : Lower Bound

5) Big O : complexity
-> 1. constant time : O(1)
   2. linear time : O(n)
   3. logarithmic time : O(logN)
   4. Quadratic time : O(N^2)
   5. Cubic time : O(N^3)
